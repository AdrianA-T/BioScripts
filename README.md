# BioScripts folder

A set of scripts developed for different biological analysis

# 1 Quantification vesicles: 
Script for FIJI to partially automatize the measurement of the confocal intensities to study the distribution of fluorescence signal in vesicles along the samples loaded

# 2 Study_Ptc_Gradients: 
Script in Matlab language to organize the experimental profiles of Ptc gradient in Drosophila wing disc tissue. It normalizes and translates the confocal intensities from different samples to compute the characteristic mean and variability of Ptc profiles for a experimental condition. 

# 3 Statistical and graphical study: 
Script in Matlab language to study a set of experimental data distributions, to compute the statistical p values under different test (according to the normality of the distributions) and to plot the final data in violin plots.
